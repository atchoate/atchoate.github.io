                        <p>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away .... well, okay, it was in Mesquite, Texas, which is not so far, but this was even before the original Star Wars was released, so that counts as ancient history. <br>
                            <br>
                        Anyways, in that particular time and place, a group of preschool students (including me) offered up their favorite recipes. This 'cookbook' is the result. <br>
                        <br>
                        Enjoy, and should you actually attempt any of these culinary creations, please wear protective gear and have a fire extinguisher handy. <br>
                        <br>
                        And send pics. <br>
