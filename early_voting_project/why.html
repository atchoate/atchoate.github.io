                <p class="rail-txt">I started looking into this during the 2018 midterm elections. People were flocking to early voting locations and setting turnout records, and I wondered: <i>How many people vote early, and how many wait until Election Day?</i> The answer wasn't as easy to find as I expected it to be, and the numbers revealed something interesting.</p>

                <p class="body-txt">It’s not that the state’s statistics are wrong or lying. Those numbers measure early voting turnout against all registered voters, which is a standard way to determine turnout. </p>

                        <p class="body-txt">Those numbers do not, however, answer the question I had: Of the votes cast in a particular election, how many were cast before Election Day?</p>
                        <p class="body-txt">It turns out that early and mail-in ballots have made up an increasing share of votes cast in every election since 2000, even in midterm years when Texas’ already dismal voter turnout dropped precipitously.</p>
