                <p class="rail-txt">I started looking into this during the 2018 midterm elections. People were flocking to early voting locations and setting turnout records, and I wondered: <i>How many people vote early, and how many wait until Election Day?</i> The answer wasn't as easy to find as I expected it to be, and the numbers revealed something interesting.</p>

                <p class="body-txt">Data can show trends but doesn’t necessarily explain itself. However, there are several possibilities and lines of inquiry that can be explored, including:</p>
                <ul class="body-txt">
                    <li>Increasing partisanship means people have made up their minds and are ready to vote.</li>
                    <li>Organized campaigns want to “lock in” votes once they find support.</li>
                    <li>Early and mail-in voting are more convenient than traveling to a specific polling place on a specific day.</li>
                    <li>Were there changes in early voting policy that helped drive this trend?</li>
                    <li>Did the passage of a Texas voter ID law have an impact? </li>
                    <li>As the Texas population has increased, have there been demographic changes that contribute to increased early voting?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="body-txt">Whatever factors are driving this trend, it is reasonable to expect it to continue when voting starts in the already rancorous 2020 election. </p>
